## About ##

Simple realization of MVC pattern, using Articles as a base idea of project.

You can see it working [here](http://study.igonik.ru/php_project/php) as well. But it need a bit of work still. So password in personal contacts;)

## Requirements ##

- PHP 5.2.x or higher
- Passion about programming and clear mind;)

## Quick Start ##

First clone the repository

```php
<?php
    some php code..
    later on
?>
```

Then you are ready to start! Bazinga will load any other libraries for you.  
If you work in the `MANUAL` mode, you have to define all class paths in the `init` array.
